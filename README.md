# Cerebral-React-Demo

Cerebraljs is a tool to manage state in React project (like Reduxjs), since it's a little bit complex for communication between react components.

This is a demo that shows how Cerebraljs associating with Reactjs.

## Getting started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the react app:

```bash
npm start
```

Optionally, you can [download debugger](https://github.com/cerebral/cerebral-debugger/releases) and install it to see how sequences were called and how state was changed. When you open debugger, just add `localhost:8585`, of cause you can modify this host in root `index.js`.
